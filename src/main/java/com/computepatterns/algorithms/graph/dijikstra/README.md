# Dijkstraâ€™s shortest path algorithm
Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph.
Given the source node, dijikstra's algorithm find the shortest path between the source and all other nodes.
Algorithm more or less follows greedy approach to choose the best possible node from the given node.
